# UNSW MQ EY 2024 Actuarial Case Competition

## Case Overview

A major Australian bank has recently observed a significant increase in customer churn across multiple business lines (retail, business and institutional banking). A surprising number of customers, both old and new, shift their business to competitors. In addition to this, there has been noticeable reduction in the acquisition of new customers. Consequently, the bank is concerned about the potential implications this might have on its financial position, risk profile and overall strategy.

In your role as a banking actuary, you have been tasked with understanding the observed trends and proposing a strategy to reverse or manage the high rate of customer churn. The client is interested in understanding the potential implications customer churn has on the bankâ€™s financial position, risk profile and strategy. For your analysis, the client asked you to select one of the business lines (retail, business banking or institutional banking) and focus on it when answering the relevant questions.

1. **Customer Churn Risks**: Address how customer churn may impact credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk
2. **Market Conditions**: Outline the impact that current and future market conditions may have on the customer churn rate
3. **Modelling Customer Churn**: How could actuarial tools and techniques, such as predictive modelling, be utilised by the bank to better understand the cause of the customer churn and to predict future trends?
4. **Initiative Design**: Design and propose a solution or an initiative that the bank could undertake to reverse the trend of customer churn. Using any major Australian bank as an example, quantify and discuss the impact of the proposed solution on the financial position of the bank

Allowed 3 weeks to develop a comprehensive presentation to be submitted.

## Data Analysis and Modelling

### Modelling and Forecasting Customer Churn

- **Objective**: Showcase a variety of predictive modelling techniques to analyse the impacts on customer churn. How can the bank forecast customer churn using such models?
- **Methodology**: Customer data can be used in a logistic regression and cox regression to estimate the probability a customer will leave the bank. Macroeconomic data can be used in a linear regression to identify market impacts on customer churn and forecast future trends
- **Evaluation**: Utilised central bank and census data to build a linear regression to predict external refinancing (when customers switch to different lender), and direct-entry payments (value of transactions between ADIs). This builds an estimate of the customer churn rate which the predictive models can be used to forecast chustomer churn. These models yield a training error between **0.42%-2.32%**.

### Initiative Design

- **Approach**: Leverage behavioural economic insights to build a large-scale innovative solution. Quantify the impact using stochastic modelling techniques
- **Methodology**: Utilised research and experimental papers to create an online community and financial advice platform. Quantitative analysis of the solution was done using stochastic modelling by building a control matrix model and solution matrix model. Utilised simulations to quantify the impact in reducing customer churn.

## Key Achievements

### Recognition and Challenges

- Submitted PowerPoint presentation which summarises analysis, modelling, and recommendations which I led a 4-person team
